# Clever Visual Studio Code

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidBabel/clever-vscode/master/images/icon-small.png" style="width: 120px; float: left; margin: 20px">

**Clever vscode** was initially a personnal project to provide some missing features to the editor. Especially __Sublime Text__ one, my former love.

After sharing it with almost all my friends they motivate me to push it for cummunity.

Suggestions, PR or ideas for embed macros are very welcome.

Think about [rating and review](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davidbabel.Clever).

- and i'm aware of your ideas ([submit yours](#contribs))

Every feature comes with keybinding suggestions. On install, this extension does not set any keybinding to prevent issues with different countries keyboard compatibility and allow you to only use the keybindings you need.

So you have to set it manually in your `keybindings.json`. We are developpers, we made the `json` version ;)

## Fast block select

_Demo_

__Note__ that this is a single same shortcut allowing this result :

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidBabel/clever-vscode/master/images/examples/block-clever.gif)

_Binding suggestion:_

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+r",
  "mac": "cmd+r",
  "command": "clever.blockSelect.cleverSelect",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

If needed, the following commands are also provided :

```js
clever.blockSelect.quotes;          // " " , ' ' , ` `
clever.blockSelect.parenthesis;     // ( )
clever.blockSelect.squareBrackets;  // [ ]
clever.blockSelect.curlyBrackets;   // { }
clever.blockSelect.angleBrackets;   // <AngleBracket>  </AngleBracket>
clever.blockSelect.inTag;           // <> inTag </>
```

I recommand you to bind them to something like `cmd+k '` or `cmd+k (` etc ... It's very handy and may not create binding conflicts.

## Toggle maximise current editor

_Demo_

__Note:__ this is especially helpfull on a side comparaison during commit diff

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidBabel/clever-vscode/master/images/examples/toggle-maximize.gif)

_Binding suggestion:_

```json
{
  "key": "shift+ctrl+enter",
  "mac": "shift+cmd+enter",
  "command": "clever.maximize.toggleWithSidebar",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

If needed, the following command is also provided :

```js
clever.maximize.toggleWithoutSidebar
```


## Advanced macros

The Macro feature allows you to execute a list of vscode commands or any extensions commands, including "clever vscode" ones.

It also provides two helpers commands (see examples below for API):

- a `wait` helper to be able to manage async commands (especially extension ones which may miss to await callbacks).
- a `type` helper to insert text, like a "programmatic snippet".

Each macro is a "config / keybinding" combo. The wanted macro got a name, and an array of commands :

### Add fragment macro example

_Demo_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidBabel/clever-vscode/master/images/examples/macro-fragment.gif)

_Configs_

```js
{
  "clever.macros": {
    "exampleAddFragment": [ // macro name to remember in bindings
      "type:<>\n\n</>",     // type command with text param
      "cursorUp"            // 2nd command
    ],
    "betterAddFragment": [
      "type:<>\n$1\n</>"    // type also support snippet syntax
    ]
    // "otherMacro": [/* commands list */]
    // ...
  }
}
```

_Binding suggestion:_

```json
{
  "key": "whatever you want",
  "command": "clever.macros.betterAddFragment",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

__Note:__ to find every commands available, browse it in the shortcut palette `cmd+k cmd+s`

### Sublime Text file navigation macro example

Another example, this macro allow to fastOpen a file without loosing focus from the file explorer (sublime text style).

_Demo_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidBabel/clever-vscode/master/images/examples/macro-quickopen.gif)

This workflow is amazing, it allows you to not use your mouse to open quickly multiple files. Check the [advanced config guide](#create-the-best-editor) to create a enhanced navigation system into vscode.

_Configs_

```js
{
  "clever.macros": {
    "fastOpenFile": [
      "list.select",                   // open current hover file
      "wait:20",                       // wait for 20ms before next (default 50ms)
      "workbench.action.focusSideBar"  // send focus back to the file explorer
    ],
    "openAndKeepFile": [
      "list.select",                   // open current hover file
      "workbench.action.files.save",   // this will keep the file open
      "wait:20",                       // wait for 20ms before next (default 50ms)
      "workbench.action.focusSideBar"  // send focus back to the file explorer
    ],
    "openFile": [
      "list.select",                   // open current hover file
      "workbench.action.files.save",   // this will keep the file open
    ]
  }
}
```

_Binding suggestion:_

__Note:__ to be able to map "enter" here you have to unbind it first. (see the [advanced config guide](#create-the-best-editor) to do so)

```js
{
  "key": "right",
  "command": "clever.macros.fastOpenFile",
  "when": "explorerViewletVisible && filesExplorerFocus && !explorerResourceIsRoot && !inputFocus"
},
{
  // note : "enter" must be unbind first
  "key": "enter",
  "command": "clever.macros.openAndKeepFile",
  "when": "explorerViewletVisible && filesExplorerFocus && !explorerResourceIsRoot && !inputFocus"
},
{
  "key": "left",
  "command": "clever.macros.openFile",
  "when": "explorerViewletVisible && filesExplorerFocus && !explorerResourceIsRoot && !inputFocus"
}
```

### Rebind any key to another

The following will insert a `b` when you type a `j`. It works with any key, especially special characters.

_Configs_

```js
{
  "clever.macros": {
    "b": ["type:b"]
  }
}
```

_Binding example:_

```json
{
  "key": "j",
  "command": "clever.macros.b",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

## Create the best editor

Here is a complete guide to custom your editor the right way.

This does not need any extension, only modify the editor `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` the right way.

## Inspirations & credits

- document parser by Vilic : https://github.com/vilic/vscode-es-quotes
- selecting library by dbankier https://github.com/dbankier/vscode-quick-select

## Why embed other libraries

For me, the features provided by the embed library are from far, the big miss in vscode base commands. I had to modify some of it to add new awesome features.

Also, as i said in introduction, i made this library for myself initially, and include them to be sure they will never disapear or stop to be maintained with a possible incompatible vscode version.
